Evan Evaniuk's personal website.

Made as a portfolio of myself. Website resume's aren't really helpful for Embedded engieers like me, but I want to practice something new. 
So this website will be a testbench for me for a little while until i learn a bit mroe about dev.  

Things I want on the website:
- landing page should be my bio. couple of sentences explaining who i am and what i do. currentley employed, and focus area in school.
- Projects tab. I'm not totally sure what i want this to look like yet, but i think i want categories of projects? i dont have lots of completed projects but i have things like home improvment (the balcony), electronics, programming and 3D printing. So i want to sortof sort that.
    - If the project is programmed, then try to integrate it into the website. 
- I was thinking hobbies, but my biggest hobby is 3D printing and video games. so maybe it kinda all mashes together. im not sure though. it might be a good place to put other intrests like music, camping/traveling and video games
- obviously links to socials and contact info
- Big thing i kinda wanted to do was to outline my skills and the projects I did that showcase my capabilities in that skill. So maybe i can link to the relevant projects but i want skills to be its own thing.
- associations. So the CSBE, SE, IEEE

Some inspirations:

These are nothing crazy, but the general flow is what im looking for. The first one is kindof tricky still since its made with a website. i tried understanding it basedo nthe source, but i dont understand much yet.
